# Netflix: Streaming Subscribers and Genre Worldwide Analysis

## Introduction

Netflix Inc. is a premier provider of entertainment services known for its subscription-based streaming service which includes a wide array of movies and television programs, featuring numerous in-house productions. Since its inception in 1997, Netflix has expanded its services to over 180 countries and dramatically increased its library with 126 original series and films. This project aims to analyze Netflix's subscriber growth, revenue generation, and genre popularity across different regions.

## Project Ambition

The main goal of this project is to provide insights into where Netflix should focus its efforts to maximize performance, leveraging data from multiple countries.

## Research Questions

The analysis is structured around several key questions:
1. Has the number of subscribers increased or decreased over the years?
2. How is revenue distributed among countries?
3. Is there a correlation between the number of subscribers and revenue?
4. Which country has the highest number of subscribers?
5. In which countries is Netflix accessible?
6. What are the most popular genres?
7. What is the relationship between the number of movies released and subscriber growth?

## Methodology

Three distinct datasets were utilized:
- `Netflix_Subscribers`: Includes data on subscriber numbers and revenue by country.
- `Netflix_titles`: Contains metadata about individual shows and movies.
- `Netflix_data`: Enriches the titles dataset with additional categorical data.

These datasets were merged and analyzed to provide comprehensive insights into the viewing preferences and growth metrics of Netflix globally.

## Data Analysis Tools

- **Tableau**: Utilized for creating dynamic and interactive visualizations.
- **Excel**: Served as the preliminary data preparation tool.

## Key Findings

- **Subscriber Growth**: Significant growth in subscriber numbers was observed in specific regions, with detailed year-over-year comparisons.
- **Revenue Insights**: Analysis showed how revenue is not only tied to subscriber numbers but also to regional content preferences.
- **Genre Popularity**: Documentaries and stand-up comedy are identified as globally popular genres, indicating potential areas for content development.

## Dashboards and Visuals

Several dashboards were created to visualize data effectively, helping to understand complex datasets at a glance and make informed decisions.

## Conclusions

This analysis provided a clear view of Netflixâ€™s global reach, subscriber base, and financial success. It also highlighted the importance of genre-based content strategy tailored to regional preferences.

## Future Work

This project's methodology allows for easy updating and extension. Annual updates are planned to keep the analysis relevant and reflective of new data.
